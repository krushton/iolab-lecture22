IO Lab 22: Chrome Extensions
=====================
For this lab you will build two Chrome extensions.
* Part A: An extension that uses content scripts to modify the content of a web page in some way.
* Part B: An extension that enables users to quickly look up information on Wikipedia. This extension should add a new right-click menu option that appears when the user highlights some text. When they select this option, the extension should launch a new tab in Chrome and load the matching wikipedia page.
